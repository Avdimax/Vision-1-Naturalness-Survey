# Dialogue Naturalness Assessment Study

Thank you for your interest in participating in this research study on evaluating the naturalness and realism of conversational dialogues in English. This project assesses how native and non-native speakers perceive spoken interactions, particularly in educational and cultural contexts involving Iranian themes.[^1][^2]

## Study Overview

You will evaluate **5 different dialogues** by listening to audio recordings and reading the accompanying text, then answering questions on overall naturalness, specific linguistic aspects, and providing brief feedback. Each dialogue features everyday scenarios, such as museum visits, observatory talks, library discussions, travel planning, and casual requests, with audio for dialogues 1-4 provided via MP3 files. The study takes about 15-20 minutes to complete and contributes to improving AI-generated or scripted speech in language learning tools.[^2][^1]

## How to Participate

1. Visit the live survey site hosted on GitHub Pages at `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name` (replace with your actual URL after deployment).[^1][^2]
2. Begin by completing the required demographic information: first name, age, nationality, education level, and native English variety (e.g., American, British).[^2][^1]
3. For each dialogue, play the audio (use headphones in a quiet space), read the text, and rate on scales from 1-5 for aspects like grammar, vocabulary, pacing, and cultural relevance.[^1][^2]
4. Provide short open-ended responses on what feels natural, awkward, or suggestions for improvement.[^2][^1]
5. Submit your responses; they will be saved as a JSON file for download and analysis.[^2]

## Important Guidelines

Complete the survey in a distraction-free environment and use headphones for clear audio playback of the dialogues. All questions marked with * are required; your honest feedback is valuable for the research. Participation is voluntary, anonymous, and confidential—responses are not linked to personal identifiers beyond a generated participant ID.[^1][^2]
